# HLFthesisproject
This project was created for my masters thesis (defended June 25, 2021) as a proof-of-concept blockchain-based system for sharing quality data across a supply chain.
The project is based on Hyperledger Fabric 3x and was designed to run on 4 (VPS) servers, each hosting a single orderer node, peer node, and corresponding CAs.
